# TuentiChallenge7

Here are my solutions (1-5) for Tuenti Challenge 7 in JavaScript

I finished [129th of 1490 participants](http://web.archive.org/web/20170509172910/https%3A%2F%2Fcontest.tuenti.net%2Fstats), I think it's not bad because it's my first tuenti challenge. I will hope to be in of top100 next year. ðŸ¤“
